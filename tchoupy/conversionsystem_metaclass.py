class ConversionSystem(type):
    """Class factory (metaclass) for systems of unit conversions.

    Take any number of unit names and conversion rules between some of these and
    return a class. Any instance of this class will then be a physical quantity
    that can be expressed within this system of units and easily converted
    into any valid unit.
    Moreover, each generated class overrides most of arithmetic operation
    builtins (e.g. __add__) so that instances can easily be manipulated as
    numbers with +-*/** (although with an associated physical dimension).

        ------
        ValueError
            Some unit name contains non-alphabetical characters or consists
            of a single 'o'. A single 'o' is protected because it is used to
            denote a fraction bar in attribute names. For instance if x is an
            instance of cls representing 1 sqrt(Hz), x.Hz1o2 calls for the
            value of x in sqrt(Hz) (/ is not a valid character for an
            attribute name, and _ is already used to denote a negative power,
            e.g. (x**-2).Hz_2 ).
        KeyError
            A compound unit refered to a unit that had not been defined yet.
            Recall that keyword arguments can be ordered in a unique way in
            python, as dictionaries can as long as their size is not modified.
